Showdown Demo
-------------

You can try out Showdown on this page:

  - Type some [Markdown] text on the left side.
  - See the corresponding HTML on the right.

For a Markdown cheat-sheet, switch the right-hand window from *Preview* to *Syntax Guide*.

Showdown is a JavaScript port of the original Perl version of Markdown.  You can get the full [source code] by clicking on the version number at the bottom of the page.

Also check out [WMD, the Wysiwym Markdown Editor][wmd].  It'll be open source soon; email me at the address below if you'd like to help me test the standalone version.

**Start with a blank page or edit this document in the left window.**
